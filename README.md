Recently, we found that some papers exploring the risk factors about diabetic complications. However, these papers mainly used GWAS incorporating diabetic complications as cases and general populations without diabetes as controls. Using the type of GWAS, it is difficult to distinguish if the exposure is related to diabetes itself or its complications. Thus, we use one article (PMID: 38751358) as an example to describe this concern and suggest solutions. We provided related code. 

In this code, we used multivariable MR to explore the direct effect of Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group on the risk of T1D with renal complications, T1D with neurological complications, and T1D with ophthalmic complications with adjustment for genetic effects of T1D.
